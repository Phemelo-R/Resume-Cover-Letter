A B.Sc. graduate in Biodiversity and Conservation Biology at the University of the Western Cape, currently studying B.Sc. (Hons) in biodiversity and Conservation Biology – to be completed in December 2025. My research project is on monitoring \textit{Leucadendron argenteum} populations in Table Mountain National Park using NASA’s hyperspectral imaging and LiDAR sensors in collaboration with the South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON). I am skilled in using modern technology and software to solve biodiversity and conservation problems. My experience comes from field research, geographic information systems (GIS), and open-source scientific scripting languages such as R and Python. I have proven teamwork and leadership skills through volunteering programmes and tutoring. I am a motivated person who can adapt to any environment, I am willing to learn new skills and gain experience to better myself. I am fluent in English, Sesotho, Zulu, Xhosa, Setswana, and Sepedi.
